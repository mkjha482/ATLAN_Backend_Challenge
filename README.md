## Database & Google-Sheets Integration with HTML Forms

This setup acts as a plug-n-play integration for any HTML form to collect and store data in Google Sheets or MySQL database servers. It can also check for certain parameters before saving the data in Google-sheets or MySQL database.<br>
The data can then be retrieved to perform other functions or calculation on it i.e., further processing. <br>

Requirements:- <br>
&ensp; &ensp; a. Python (Version 3.0 and above):<br>
     &emsp; &ensp; * Pandas library<br>
&ensp; &ensp; b. Google Cloud Platform Service Account<br>
&ensp; &ensp; c. Google-Sheets APIs<br>
&ensp; &ensp; d. MySQL Server<br>
&ensp; &ensp; e. PHP (version 5.0 and above)<br>
&ensp; &ensp; f. JavaScript<br>
&ensp; &ensp; g. HTML-5<br>

As soon as the user fills the form, the data is checked for any constraints that have been placed and once it passes all the constraints, it is then updated/added to the Google-Sheets integrated with this and the MySQL Server(script for that will be uploaded soon). The data can then be retrieved by the data_retrieval.py script from the Google-sheet and further operations can be performed on it as and when required. <br>
